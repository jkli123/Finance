1. Version Log
===========

17/5/2017 - Ver 1.00 - Beta version testing complete. Rolled out Finance.jar file 
		  for implementation and usage.


===========
2. Introduction
===========

This finance applet uses java as its main language. Contains a GUI that is the most basic
and allows you to keep track of the finances of 3 accounts; Posb, Cimb and Cash. Basic
adding of expenses and income to the different account is possible. Transfer between
accounts is also possible. The applet also allows viewing of the transactions that are made
of the different types. Sorting of the tables are allowed automatically but editing is 
disallowed. More improvements will be made to the applet as time comes along.

3.  Capabilities of Finance Keeper
==========================

a. Add Expense
Allows you to add expenses to the specific account. Pops up a new window that will ask
for details regarding the expense. Fill in accordingly with special note taken to the field, type,
as it only accepts "Posb", "Cimb" or "Cash" w/o the quotes. Any other combination of words
will result in your expense not being added correctly.

b. Add Income
Allows you to add income to the specific account. Pops up a new window that will ask for 
details regarding the income. Take due note that the field, type, only accepts "Posb", "Cimb" 
or "Cash" w/o the quotes. Any other combination of words will result in your income not 
being added correctly.

c. Add Transfer
Allows you to transfer funds between the different accounts. Pops up a new window that will
ask for details regarding the transfer. Take due note that the 2 fields, from and to, 
only accepts "Posb", "Cimb" or "Cash" w/o the quotes. Any other combination of words will 
result in your transfer not being added correctly.

d. Save
A mostly experimental capability with no real functionality other than to store up the account
values at specific times. This allows you to save the value of the different accounts to a .File
extension file that can be loaded from using load function. However, this does not change
the amount in the original Account.txt file and in order to commit a change to that file, a
transaction has to be made. Be careful when using this function.

e. Load
Loads a file that has values of account stored in them. Take note that other types of files will
not work and only the original Account.txt file will be loaded if selected or any other .File that
is user created using the Save function. This will also not change the amount in the original
Account.txt file until a new transaction is made.

f. GetHelp
This function allows you to open this GetHelp.txt file.
